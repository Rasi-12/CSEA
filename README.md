In this project, I developed a comprehensive website for the Computer Science and Engineering Association (CSEA), featuring multiple pages such as Home, About, Announcements, Office Bearers, and Winners. I designed an engaging layout with a lavender blush background, included vibrant event images, and implemented attractive CSS styles for a polished look. Additionally, I added detailed information about office bearers, organized events with winners, and highlighted upcoming activities, enhancing user experience and functionality throughout the site.
